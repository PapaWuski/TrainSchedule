# TrainSchedule

Using Firebase, a user can add a train schedule to the list and have the list persist between different machines. Train times will update each time the user loads the app.


## Verion 1
Currently, the program allows the user to input a new train as long as there are characters within the given fields. It will alert the user if there is a field that is empty and needs to be filed. The app will then generate the next time possible train time along with how many minutes away the next train will be based on the current time that the user submits the form.

updates for the future include refreshing the program so that the minutes away will more accurate reflect what the current time is rather than the static current time. other updates will include the ablity to delete a train.
